# win-console-colors

A header file that contains all 256 Windows console colors. There is also a cpp file that I used for generating this header. So if you would want to change the naming style you can do that easliy (it would be probably faster for you to write it yourself by now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯).

Anyway have fun!
